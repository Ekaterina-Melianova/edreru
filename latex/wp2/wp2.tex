\section{Depreciation of Human Capital \\ in the Russian Federation}

Age-earnings profiles are almost invariably concave downward shaped. Earnings rise after a labor market entrant completes full-time schooling. The profile indicates a peak in earnings, usually a few years before retirement, after which there is a steady decline in earnings. The concave shape is an outcome of two countervailing tendencies - the rise attributed to continued accumulation of human capital through training and the decline due to depreciation. The precise shape and location of the peak is an object of analytical interest. Depreciation of human capital is useful to investigate from a policy perspective. Just like some physical capital (machinery, buildings) are built stronger and last longer, is it possible that some kinds of education inherently generate human capital that is slower to depreciate? What attributes of the labor market lead to lower or higher levels of depreciation? What about the welfare implications of changes in the age at which individuals retire from the labor force? How has the depreciation rate of human capital changed over time in the Russian Federation? In particular, can changes in the rate of depreciation explain the observed pattern of the rates of return depicted in \ref{fig:1.2}?  

\subsection{Analytical Treatment of Depreciation} 

\citet{rosen_176._1976}  and \citet{mincer_175._1982} presented early treatments on the depreciation of human capital. However, in terms of a focus on depreciation, a seminal paper of \citet{neuman_091._1995} established the basic parameters that have guided the research since that time. The authors introduce the important distinction between two kinds of depreciation or loss of productive potential of human capital. The first one, termed as ``obsolescence" or ``vintage effect", is due to an overall upgrading of technology or the operation of other market forces that lowers the value of education or training obtained in a previous period. This is also termed as an `external depreciation", presumably as it is a given for an individual. The second kind of depreciation is attributed to the deterioration of physical and mental abilities of an individual due to the progression of a person's age, or the simple passage of time. This is also termed as ``internal depreciation". Neuman and Weiss posited that external effects would be more important for higher levels of education, under the assumption that changes in the labor market are transmitted more readily to higher education. They give the example that a recently educated electrical engineer would be learning many new things compared to one who studied the same subject in an earlier time. Neuman and Weiss reasoned that workers with basic education levels may not suffer as much from obsolescence. 

Figure \ref{fig:2.1} shows for the Russian Federation the effects described by Neuman and Weiss. There are three panels in the figure, and three lines in each figure. The vertical axis indicates the monthly earnings in constant 2018 rubles, using the Rosstat CPI deflator. The horizontal axis indicates the years of experience. The dotted line shows the earnings for 1998, the dashed line represents 2006 and the solid line the data from 2018. Each of the panels, representing a different level of education, shows an upward drift in the experience-earnings profiles in the period from 1998 to 2018. Only Figure \ref{fig:2.1a} shows a clear concave downwards profile for Higher Education; the concave tendency is less pronounced for the other two levels of Vocational education and Secondary education.

	\end{figure}
	
Putting the curves together by year (Figure \ref{fig:2.2})suggests that the premium for university education over the other two levels does narrow at higher levels of experience. In the figure, to accomodate the relatively lower wage levels of 1998, the leftmost panel (Figure \ref{fig:2.2a}) is slightly compressed compared to the other two panels. The  converging tendency between levels of education would suggest that depreciation is indeed higher for university graduates. In the next two subsections, we present a more rigorous quantitative treatment of this issue, using a variant of Neuman-Weiss developed by \citet{murillo_172._2006} and an alternative approach developed by \citet{arrazola_132b._2005}.

\subsection{Differential Depreciation Affecting Education and Training}
	
\citet{murillo_172._2006} implemented a variation of the Neuman and Weiss model with a focus on empirical implementation to Spain. We follow the Murillo notation in the implementation of the model, which begins with the following earnings equation: 
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.1} 
log(W_{T}) = \alpha + \beta_{1}KS_{T} +  \beta_{2}KE_{T} &&
\end{flalign}
\noindent
where $W$ represents earnings, $KS$ the stock of human capital derived from schooling of $S$ years, and $KE$ the stock of human capital acquired from on the job training or experience, and $T$ indexes the number of experience years since completing formal education. In this set-up, the parameters $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ are the productivity parameters for the respective parts of the stock of human capital. Both are assumed to suffer from depreciation or the loss of productive value. At this stage, we do not distinguish between the causes (internal or external) of this loss. The path of the stock of human capital due to education is given by 
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.2} 
KS_{T} = S + hTS &&
\end{flalign} 
\noindent
where $h$ is the rate of loss of the stock. The next equation for the loss of stock gained from experience is a bit more complicated. The stock from schooling, $S$ is taken to be fixed at the end of the full-time schooling period and the beginning of the working period. However, experience is being built up every year at the same time as the capital acquired from previous experience depreciates. 
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.3} 
KE_{T} = \{1 + (T-1)\cdot\gamma \} + \{1 + (T-2)\cdot\gamma \}  + \{1 + (T-3)\cdot\gamma \} + \ldots + \{1\}  && 
\end{flalign} 
\noindent
where $\gamma$ is the rate of loss applied every year. The equation can be simplified and summarized as
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.4} 
KE_{T} =  T + \gamma\cdot\{(T-1) + (T-2) + (T-3) + \ldots + 1\} = T + \gamma\cdot\frac{T^2}{2}   && 
\end{flalign} 
Substituting equations \ref{eq:2.2} and \ref{eq:2.4} into equation \ref{eq:2.1}, we get
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.5} 
log(W) = \alpha +  \beta_{1}S +  \beta_{1}hTS + \beta_{2}T + \frac{\beta_{2}\gamma}{2}T^{2} =  \alpha +  \beta_{1}S + \pi_{1}TS + \beta_{2}T + \pi_{2}T^{2} && 
\end{flalign} 
\noindent
where $\pi_{1} = \beta_{1}h$ and $\pi_{2} = \frac{\beta_{2}\gamma}{2}$. 
\vspace{2pt}
\noindent
From \ref{eq:2.5}, the depreciation rate during $T$ years applied to schooling can be computed as $\pi_{1}S $ and the depreciation rate applied to experience as $ 2\pi_{2}T$.
\vspace{-5pt}
\subsubsection{Estimation Results}
Table \ref{tab:2.1} shows OLS estimation results of equation \ref{eq:2.5} run on the whole sample of the RLMS observations. In this subsection, we analyzed separately six years that represent the ends (1994 and 2018), the diffused peak (2003 and 2006), and halfway points to the ends (2012 and 2003) of the available time interval. The idea is to examine the role played by changes in depreciation to explain the observed pattern of variation in the rates of return shown in Figure \ref{fig:1.1}. 

Using the coefficient estimates derived from Table \ref{tab:2.1}, we compute the depreciation rate during $T$ years applied to schooling as $\pi_{1}S $ and the depreciation rate applied to experience as $ 2\pi_{2}T$, evaluating the expression at the mean level of schooling. Table \ref{tab:2.2} reports the depreciation rate values so calculated with the corresponding sample means. The table shows an interesting U-shaped pattern in the depreciation rate for human capital, attributable mainly to the depreciation rate associated with experience. The depreciation rate associated with education has been declining steadily and did not pick up again as measured with the given data. The depreciation rate associated with experience declined at first and then picked up again. 

Further work is required, including computation of the depreciation rates at levels other than the mean values. At this stage, the findings raise some interesting questions which needs to be addressed by further research. In the period from 1994 to 2006, the depreciation rate appears to be declining, just as the rates of return were on an ascending curve. As both kinds of depreciation (for experience and education) were declining, it is possible that the main cause was in the labor market experience rather than in the education system. Since the peak of earnings premiums in the 2003-2006 period, as returns to education have declined, we see that the depreciation rates associated with experience have started climbing back, but depreciation rates associated with education have declined to null and not reverted. It is tempting to claim that this indicates a qualitative improvment in the skills provided by the education system, but further investigation is warranted before making such a claim. We explore next an alternative computation of the depreciation rate.

\subsection{Depreciation of Human Capital using Non-Linear Least Squares}

\citet{arrazola_132b._2005} developed an alternative approach the issue of human capital depreciation with a first principles approach regarding the formation of human capital, providing an empirical estimation for Spain.  A number of other authors have replicated Arrazola's approach. In this paper, we follow the notation adopted by Sylvain Weber, who estimated depreciation rates for Switzerland (\citet{weber_173._2008} and \citet{weber_156._2011}). Weber starts with the definition of $s_{t}$ -- the time fraction invested into the generation of new human capital by a person at age $t$. Relying on a human capital theory implication about the decline of $s_{t}$ over the life cycle, Weber shows that the complete path of $s_{t}$ is written as follows:

\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.6} 
s_{t}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
{0} & {\text { if } t<6} \\
{1} & {\text { if } 6 \leq t<S^{\star}} \\
{\alpha-\frac{\mathlarger{\alpha}}{T-S^{*}} \cdot\left(t-S^{\star}\right)=\alpha \cdot\left(1-\frac{X_{t}}{L}\right)} & {\text { if } S^{\star} \leq t \leq T}
\end{array}\right.
\end{flalign}


\noindent
where $\alpha$ is a parameter, $S^{*}$ is the age when schooling life ends and the working one begins, $T$ is the retirement age, $L = T - S^{*}$ is the total working life length, $X_{t} = t - S^{*}$ is experience. Schooling duration is equal to $S^{*} - 6$.

The model then utilizes the standard human capital theory specification that potential earnings $E_{t}$ are exponentially related to the human capital stock:

\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.7} 
E_{t}=W \cdot \exp \left(\beta_{K} K_{t}+\beta_{Z} Z_{t}\right)
\end{flalign}



\noindent
where $W$ is a return per period on a unit of earnings capacity, $K_{t}$  is the stock of human capital at time $t$, $Z_{t}$ is a set of observable attributes supposed to influence on earnings, and $K, Z$ are the parameters of interest. The stock of human capital in period $t$ can be estimated as the sum of the stock from the previous period minus the loss due to depreciation plus the quantity generated during the $t_{th}$ period:

\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.8} 
K_{t}=K_{t-1}-\delta \cdot K_{t-1}+\Delta K_{t}=(1-\delta) \cdot K_{t-1}+\Delta K_{t}
\end{flalign}

By recursion, an expression for $K_{t}$ as a function of the human capital stock acquired at the end of formal education $K_{S}$ is given by:

\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.9}
K_{t}=(1-\delta)^{t} \cdot K_{S}+\sum_{j=S^{*}}^{t-1}(1-\delta)^{j} \cdot \Delta K_{t-j}
\end{flalign}

Taking the logarithms of the expression \ref{eq:2.7} and substituting $K_{t}$ by the equation \ref{eq:2.9} leads to:

\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.10} 
\ln E_{t}=\ln W+\beta_{K} \cdot\left\{(1-\delta)^{t} \cdot K_{S}+\sum_{j=S^{*}}^{t-1}(1-\delta)^{j} \cdot \Delta K_{t-j}\right\}+\beta_{Z} Z_{t}
\end{flalign}

Next is the standard human capital relationship between observed and potential earnings. As only a proportion of $s_{t}$  of the human capital stock is  used in the actual production of earnings, observed earnings can be expressed by:

\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.11} 
\begin{aligned}
&Y_{t}=\left(1-s_{t}\right) \cdot E_{t}\\
&\ln Y_{t}=\ln \left(1-s_{t}\right)+\ln E_{t}
\end{aligned}
\end{flalign}

Combining \ref{eq:2.10} and \ref{eq:2.11} results in:

\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.12} 
\ln Y_{t}=\ln W+\beta_{K} \cdot\left\{(1-\delta)^{t} \cdot K_{S}+\sum_{j=S^{*}}^{t-1}(1-\delta)^{j} \cdot \Delta K_{t-j}\right\} + \beta_{Z} Z_{t} + \ln \left(1-s_{t}\right)
\end{flalign}

Finally, as the human capital stock at the end of education is related to the human capital received, there is a direct association between this stock and the schooling duration:

\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.13} 
K_{S}=S
\end{flalign}

The production of new human capital $K_{t}$ depends on the portion of time devoted to this activity:

\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.14} 
\Delta K_{t}=s_{t}=\left\{\begin{array}{ll}
{0} & {\text { if } t<6} \\
{1} & {\text { if } 6 \leq t<S^{\star}} \\
{\alpha \cdot\left(1-\frac{X_{t}}{L}\right)} & {\text { if } S^{*} \leq t \leq T}
\end{array}\right.
\end{flalign}

Using \ref{eq:2.8} and \ref{eq:2.11} to express $K_{S}$ as a sum of the human capital quantities produced during schooling, the result is:

\begin{flalign}\label{eq:2.15} 
K_{S} \stackrel{(3)}{=} \sum_{j=0}^{S^{*}}(1-\delta)^{j} \cdot \Delta K_{S^{*}-j} \stackrel{(9)}{=} \sum_{j=6}^{S^{*}}(1-\delta)^{j}
\end{flalign}

Substituting \ref{eq:2.13} and \ref{eq:2.14} into \ref{eq:2.12}, adding an error term and an individual subscript $i$  provides the equation that can be estimated using non-linear least squares (NLS):

\begin{multline}\label{eq:2.16} 
\ln Y_{i t}= \ln W+\beta_{K} \cdot\left\{(1-\delta)^{X_{i t}} \cdot S_{i}+\alpha \cdot \frac{1-(1-\delta)^{X_{i t}}}{\delta}\right.\cdot\\
\left.\left(1+\frac{1-\delta}{\delta \cdot L_{i}}\right)-\frac{\alpha \cdot X_{i t}}{\delta \cdot L_{i}}\right\}+\ln \left\{1-\left(\alpha-\frac{\alpha}{L_{i}} \cdot X_{i t}\right)\right\}+\beta_{Z} \cdot Z_{i t}+u_{i t}
\end{multline}

\noindent
where $t$ shows a time period, $\ln Y$ is a logarithm of the observed earnings, $\ln W$ is a logarithm of a return per certain period on a unit of earnings capacity, $\beta_{K}$ is the effect of the human capital stock on earnings, $\beta_{Z}$ is the effect of other covariates in the model on earning, $\delta$ is the human capital depreciation rate, $X_{i t}$ is the labor market experience, $L_{i}$ is the total working life length, $\alpha$ is a parameter reflecting the share of time invested in training, $Z_{i t}$ is a set of observable attributes hypothesized to have an impact on earnings, $u_{i t}$ is an error term.

Table \ref{tab:2.3} reports empirical findings for the estimation of the \ref{eq:2.16} equation using NLS with robust standard errors for the same range of years as presented in the previous section. Unlike that earlier model, the Arrazola model does not allow for a different treatment of depreciation of human capital acquired from schooling or from experience - only a single $\delta$ (depreciation rate of the human capital) parameter is estimated. However, the model does allow the identification of an  $\alpha$ parameter (related to post-school investment in human capital).

\setcounter{table}{3} % to avoid tabularx countine subtables as tables

The sparklines in Table \ref{tab:2.3} indicates a smilar roughly U-shaped  pattern for depreciation as reported in Table \ref{tab:2.2}, with depreciation of human capital first declining and then increasing again. This supports the narrative that the observed increase and then decrease in returns to education in the Russian Federation may be explained through the effect of depreciation. The  exact magnitudes of estimated depreciation in the two tables do not match - while the range of depreciation is similar - between 2\% to 5\%, the 2018 figures indicate a higher level in Table \ref{tab:2.3}. 

\vspace{3pt}

An intriguing finding concerns the difference in depreciation rates between female and male workers. The conventional human capital logic holds that women typically face longer periods outside of the labor market because of child-bearing and child-rearing responsibilities. Absence from the labor market would lead to higher levels of depreciation amongst women. In the case of the Russian Federation, the estimates of both Table \ref{tab:2.2} and Table \ref{tab:2.3} reflect this pattern in the first half of the period, up until the estimates for 2006. Around the time of the peak in returns, the depreciation rate drops to zero for both men and women, but in the subsequent period, the depreciation rate for men appears to be higher than the rate for women. The fact that both methodologies reflect this pattern indicates a real phenomenon, rather than a statistical artefact, and something to be explored further. 

\vspace{3pt}

Finally, a word about the $\alpha$ parameter, which is an indicator of post-schooling investment in human capital. This parameter also shows a similar tendency as the depreciation rate, meaning a decline to zero and a subsequent  increase. As with depreciation, the first half shows a higher $\alpha$ for female workers until it drops to zero for both males and females at the time of peak returns, and in the subsequent period the $\alpha$ parameter level is higher for males. 

\vspace{3pt}

Adapting a strategy adopted by (\citet{weber_173._2008} to fit the Russian context, Table \ref{tab:2.4} provides four alternative specifications displayed separately by gender. The four models portray the following combinations regarding the $\alpha$  and $\delta$ parameters: \textit{model I} - both $\alpha$ and $\delta$ are constant across education levels; \textit{model II} - $\alpha$ is constant, $\delta$ varies; \textit{model III} - $\alpha$ varies, $\delta$ is constant, \textit{model VI} - both $\alpha$ and $\delta$ vary across education levels.

\vspace{3pt}

Model I - the base model, has already been presented in Table \ref{tab:2.3} and is shown again as part of Table \ref{tab:2.4} only for easy reference. Model II, allows the $\delta$ parameter to vary across education levels; Model III allows the $\alpha$ parameter to vary across education levels; and finally Model IV allows both parameters to vary by education level. The estimates indicate the absence of depreciation effects by educational level. Weber had found for Switzerland  that depreciation is higher for vocational education, and provided the explanation that vocational education skills tend to be more specific to jobs and careers. However, this finding is not replicated with the data for the Russian Federation. The statistically signifciant finding in Table 2.4 concerns the $\alpha$ parameter. Post-schooling investment in human capital for those with vocational education is not different from those with secondary education, but university education brings with it a higher level of the $\alpha$ parameter, for both male and female workers.

\section{Further Exploration of Depreciation}
\subsection{Depreciation and the Gender dimension}

The previous section indicated an intriguing finding regarding depreciation and gender, with recent rounds of RLMS data indicating a higher level of depreciation for male workers, a possibly anamolous finding. This sub-section draws upon the literature regarding occupational gender segregation, the tendency for some jobs to be dominated by one gender, a phenomenon that has been studied in detail in labor markets around the world (\citet{preston_179_1999} and \citet{blau_178_2013}). Empirical application in the Russian Federation has examined trends regarding gender segregation in occupations (\citet{klimova_159._2009},\citet{klimova_131._2012},\citet{kosyakova_121._2015}). The bulk of this literature is concerned with the issue of the possible inequities and inefficiencies arising from gender segregation. However, for purpose of this paper is to exploit the presence in the data of occupational gender segregation to obtain insights into human capital depreciation.


In this section,we extend the Neuman and Weiss model of the previous section to compare the estimated depreciation rates between female- and male-dominated groups in various industries and occupations. The RLMS 2018 database contains information about sector or industry and standardized ISCO-08 classfication of jobs. These were used  to tag gender-based industrial sectors and occupations, respectively. The average female representation by sector was 54\%.  Using a range of $\pm$ 10\% from the average, a sector was marked as female-dominated if it contained more than 64\% of women workers, and male-dominated if it contained less than 44\% of women workers. Neutral sectors occupied the middle of the distribution. Figure \ref{fig:3.1} visualizes this procedure; Table \ref{tab:3.1} maps title of sectors with female percentages in them. To generate gender-related occupations a similar tactic was applied based on the 2-digit ISCO-08 classification (see Figure \ref{fig:3.2} and Table \ref{tab:3.2}).

The Neuman and Weiss model provides an estimation of the depreciation rate for human capital, but by itself is unable to identify how much of that  depreciation is external or internal. External depreciation is due to obsolescence (as new technologies make skills redundant) and internal depreciation is due to factors related to the individual. The previous section reported the finding that depreciation for female workers first exceeded and  then was exceeded by depreciation for male workers. Examining differences in depreciation rate by the segregation classfication helps identify between internal and external depreciation based on a conjecture. The conjecture is that external depreciation would have a greater affect by industry sector, as technological change would propagate more rapidly through a sector rather than through occupations, which are dispersed across sectors. 

Table \ref{tab:3.3} depicts average rates of human capital loss due to experience and education by the female- and male-dominated industrial sectors and occupations. Industry or sector related differences does show difference in the depreciation rate, with depreciation rate being higher for male dominated industrial sectors. These are engineering and technology oriented sectors, compared to administration, services, and education which are the female dominated sectors. The depreciation does not appear to vary across occupational groupings - male dominated and female dominated occupation groupings have similar depreciation rates. These findings need to be treated as preliminary findings as they are only point estimates of depreciation, evaluated at mean values.

\subsection{Depreciation and Occupational Routineness}

In addition to the examination of human capital depreciation rates in gender-dominated industries and occupations, we explore differences in depreciation  between groups generated by using an array of routine and non-routine task content metrics for jobs. This is important in light of discussion about computers and robots taking over routine oriented jobs. In this analysis, we rely on a recent literature of job classification based on task intensity measures  \citet{mihaylov_152._2019}. These measures are based on the textual analysis of description of jobs in the ISCO 08 classification. Each job lists a detailed set of activities or tasks performed as part of the job, and these activities are rated according to whether they are vulnerable to automation in which case they are classified as Routine (R), otherwise they are Non-Routine (NR). Tasks are also classified depending on their Cognitive (C) or Manual (M) requirements; Cognitive taks are further classified as mainly Analytic (A) or Interactive (I). The results is a five-fold classification of tasks, which is subsequently used to develop a set of measures depending on the incidence of these tasks in the job description.

For purpose of this analyis, we use two of these measures. Routine Task Intensity measure (RTI) denotes a score difference between the summed routine task indices and the summed non-routine task indices: $(RC + RM) - (NRA + NRI + NRM)$ - it is a net measure of job routineness or vulnerability to automation. We also use a gross measure that brings together the non-routine task indices: $NRA + NRI + NRM$. Using the k-means clustering technique for the metrics described, we created two respective categorical variables (drti and dnraim) with categories capturing \textit{high, medium,} and \textit{low} manifestations of the features.

Table \ref{tab:3.4} shows the results of comparing depreciation rates between individuals whose jobs invoke routine or non-routine tasks at a high, medium, or low level. The findings suggest that depreciation explained by experience does not differ substantially between people with jobs with varying routine task intensity. The same outcome also applies to workers varying in the degree of non-routine content at their jobs. As with the findings regarding gender, these should be regarded as preliminary findings subject to further analysis. However, it does appear that the automation aspect of technological change may not be affecting the rate of depreciation of skills - both routine and non-routine intensive jobs undergo depreciation, though it is possibly that the underlying causal factors may be different.
