\section*{RLMS Results}

\subsection*{Data}

To estimate returns to education in Russia we employed the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) - the longest panel survey of individuals and households in Eastern Europe and Asia (\cite{kozyreva_081._2015}) and the only representative Russian survey with a sizable panel component allowing for a dynamic analysis. The data are notable for their reliability, diversity, and applicability to a variety of research questions. The RLMS embraces information on people's income and expenditure structure, their material well-being, educational and occupational behavior, health state and nutrition, migration, etc. High standards of the survey content accepted worldwide enable to conduct a comprehensive cross-country comparison. RLMS sampling procedures have been thoroughly and extensively described elsewhere (\cite{kozyreva_081._2015}). The present research uses all 23 waves that are currently available (1994 - 2018). A sub-sample selected for the empirical investigation includes working individuals aged 25-64 who are out of school and have positive labor market experience and income.
\\

\subsection*{Methods}

Our empirical analysis pertains to the examination of a slightly modified basic specification of a mincer-type wage equation (\cite{mincer_082._1974}). We present results for the general working population of the Russian Federation aged 25-64 as well as by gender and nationality. The specification of focus is as follows:

$$Log(Wage) = b_0 + b_1\cdot Educ + b_2\cdot Exp + b_3\cdot Exp^2 + b_4\cdot Gender + b_5\cdot Nationality + \epsilon$$

where $Log(Wage)$ is a logarithm of wage, $Educ$ stands for the highest attained level of education, $Exp$ and $Exp^2$ reflect the years of working experience and its quadratic term respectively, $Gender$ is a dummy variable for gender, $Nationality$ represents a person's nationality, $b_0$ is an intercept, $b_1 ... b_n$ are the respective slope estimates, $\epsilon$ refers to a normally distributed error term.
\\

\subsection*{Measures}

\subsubsection*{Dependent variable}

For the dependent variable we used the logarithm of an average monthly wage within the past year on a person's primary job (J13.2 variable in the RLMS dataset). If a person had an additional job, the maximum wage value among the two (J13.2 and J40) was selected for the analysis. In the waves from 1994 to 1996 the above mentioned question was absent; for those waves we exploited a variable about the average amount of money earned by a respondent within the past 30 days (J10) as a reasonable approximation.
\\

\subsubsection*{Independent variables}

We distinguished 3 categories for the {\bf education} variable (EDUC): (1) secondary, (2) vocational, and (3) higher. Incomplete levels were incorporated into the respective upper categories (e.g., incomplete higher - into higher). We are interested in exploring returns to vocational and higher education. Estimations of premiums to primary and secondary schooling levels are technically unreachable to us since the amounts of adults without primary education and with only primary level are minuscule in the general population. We also refused from a strategy of measuring education metrically in years due to a tangible variability of returns at each year of education: extrapolating yearly effects to any time period of schooling might be crude and erroneous.
\\

To create a variable displaying a person's {\bf experience} we leveraged four questions on a year and a month of both primary and additional job start (J5A, J5B, J35.2Y, and J25.2M). Based on these variables and the information on an interview date, we generated a labor market experience variable for each unique respondent in the sample by summing his or her experience time registered across RLMS waves. If an employed individual had missing values on a date of his or her start of work, we imputed those missings by the first non-missing record from previous waves. If only month of a job start lacked a valid response, we roughly assumed a respondent had started his or her work in January. In cases of the absence of a valid answer with regard to those questions in both primary and additional job in all RLMS waves a person have been surveyed, such cases (< 1\%) were dropped from the analysis. List-wise deletion strategy was also applied to the observations with "negative" experience (< 1\%) when according to one's responses a job started allegedly "after" the interview occurred.
\\

In addition, we elaborated a routine for detecting and fixing inconsistent responses to the questions about experience. Such pitfalls, impeding the correct computation of the experience variable, originate from the following two circumstances:

\begin{enumerate}
\item individuals, "covering" a job starting date throughout one or several successive waves and "disclosing" it later (e.g., a respondent in 2005 mentioned he or she had started to work in 2000, however, in 2001 a different response was recorded); 

\item individuals, naming an earlier job starting date compared to the mentioned preceding dates (e.g., a respondent in 2005 said he had started to work in 2000, but in 2001 he or she replied 1995 had been in fact the beginning year of his or her working activity). 
\end{enumerate}

In both situations the priority was given to earlier responses since the closeness to the actual job starting date can potentially downgrade the probability of making a mistake by a person. Incoherence correction involved 52\% of unique respondents or 40\% of instances in the pooled RLMS database (1994 - 2018). However, it should be noted that such an approach to the labor market experience measurement is not devoid of shortcomings. Tracking people's experience based solely on information present in the dataset implies we restrict people's career paths to what has been captured exclusively by the survey. Hence we assume everyone reports on their first job start when they are interviewed for the first time, which is not always the case. Therefore, we cannot be sure on the preciseness of calculations concerning experience variable for individuals surveyed little amount of times, albeit are certain about the experience data for people, participated in the survey many times. As a counter-argument we can contend that such systematic underestimation affects everyone equally, hence leaving a relative aspect intact.
\\

There is another method of computing a person's labor market experience frequent in past research. This method equates one's experience with a time distance between his or her graduation from the last institution and a current work. Such an approach has some disadvantages as well. First, it ignores the existence of unemployment which is of particular point of concern for people lacking higher education; that is why the method disproportionately overestimates people's labor market activity. Second, it does not account for the fact that people can continuously receive their education across their life-course, thus the method neglects a qualification upsurge in older ages. Third, the approach erases the variability in experience between people of the same age.
\\

Table 1 shows the results of averaging all the three ways of generating labor market experience by "cohorts" - groups of respondents aggregated on the basis of incidence number in the RLMS survey - and comparing the obtained means by a t-test. This table demonstrates that the two corresponding versions of experience computed with (EXP 1) and without (EXP 2) inconsistency correction gradually increase with the rise of the instance number, which is expected. Moreover, they are rather close in absolute values, nevertheless, entail a statistical difference (for the bulk of the cohorts t-test p-values are lower than 0.05). Therefore, perhaps, these variables cannot be leveraged interchangeably without introducing bias into the analysis. Importantly, both EXP 1 and EXP 2 take into consideration the fact that people can change their job, thus previous working experience is added to a current value. Besides, the table poses evidence that experience based on a graduation year (EXP 3) overestimates one's labor market activity since is greater than the corrected EXP 1 even for the most frequent RLMS participants (p-values of the respective t-tests are lower than 0.05). Overall, this indicates the necessity of harmonizing the data in the described manner.

Finally, two socio-demographic variables were incorporated into the analysis, namely gender and nationality. We introduced gender in the form of a dummy variable with "1" standing for females, "0" - for males. Likewise, nationality reflected if a person did not identify him/herself as Russian.

\subsection*{Findings}

Figure 1 displays rates of returns to higher and vocational education in Russia in 1994-2018. The results suggest that on average wage premiums to university schooling in Russia are roughly 3-5 times greater than to vocational schooling depending on the year under focus. Overall, there is a moderate curved growth in both return types, achieving their peak in the early 2000s (83\% for higher education and 26\% for vocational education compared to the average earnings of workers with the secondary level), which is followed by a downward pattern (see Figure 1). This goes in line with the previous meta-analytic research (Lukyanova 2010).
\\

\end{center}
\end{figure}

Notably, gender-based trends in Russia have a different shape across time with regard to schooling premiums. Particularly, males' payoffs to higher education (varying from 45\% to 76\%) turn out to be on a slightly decreasing slope, whereas women' returns are described by an inversely U-shaped pattern, reaching their maximum of 104\% in 2001. Within the last roughly 5 years wage premiums to higher education for women have stabilized around the level of men (~50\%). A similar comparative picture is observed with respect to vocational education, however, the described regularities are way less pronounced (see Figure 2): returns for males are almost flat within the time period under focus and the parabolic association for females is tangibly less concave. The overall outcome concerning payoffs to schooling isolated by gender has been confirmed in a similar fashion by past studies (e.g., Cheidvasser and Benítez-Silva 2007; Lukyanova 2010).

\end{figure}

For Russians payoffs to higher and vocational education are characterized by a pattern almost identical to the one uncovered for the whole population. As for non-Russians, the estimates of wage advantages regarding people with university education level compared to those with only secondary level are not statistically significant in the majority of time periods investigated (except for 2002-2006 and 2008). Nevertheless, the payoffs to vocational education for those who identified themselves as non-Russians are significant and the respective time trend is loosely distinguishable from the one registered for Russians. In other words, nationality seem to affect returns to higher education, but does not play a similar part with respect to vocational education.
