# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.

Together with RStudio, you need pandoc and Miktex programs installed on your MS-Windows machine. In practice, I need to change the codechink background and the only way I could determine to do this was to edit the intermediate .tex file, though it is also possible to force rmarkdown to follow a different template for latex, in which case you would need to
follow the instructions in 3.3.7.4 at \url{https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/pdf-document.html} 

## Getting the rawdata

The data was downloaded from the ESS website with the help of R package essurvey - you need an easily obtainable userid in the form of an e-mail for that purpose and login one time, then with R you only need to specify the login userid e-mail. As of October 19, 2019, latest available data was Round 8. \newline

```{r Load_Data}

load("C:/Country/Russia/Data/SEABYTE/ESS/downloads/ess_all_rounds.rdata")

# Start with round 8 of ESS data

round8 <- as.data.frame(all_rounds[8])

```


## Preliminaries

I successively filter for (i) Country; (ii) Main income is labor income; (iii) worked for pay last week;(iv) household income is not missing; (v) number of household members is at least 1; (vi) education level is clearly identifiued; and (vii) age is between 25 and 64 years of age (inclusive).

I then define the variables to use in a Mincerian regression - starting with income from deciles using ESS documentation.

# First case is of Austria

The ESS data is harmonized across all countries in the sample.


```{r define subset Austria}
round8_AT <- round8 %>% filter(cntry=="AT") %>% filter(hincsrca==1) %>%
  filter(pdwrk==1) %>%  
  filter(!is.na(hinctnta)) %>%  filter(hhmmb>=1) %>% filter(edulvlb!=5555) %>% 
  filter(agea %in% (25:64)) %>% 
  select(brncntr,hhmmb,gndr,agea,edulvlb,eduyrs,hinctnta,dweight,pspwght,pweight)

# Succesively select for main income source is labor income, 
# at least 1 member of household, worked for pay last week,
# non-missing household income,education level identifiable,
# age between 25 and 64.

# Define variables of interest

# Mid-point income # from EESA Income definitions Appendix A2 page 3 for Austria
# atry_h atrributed labor income household
# income is nominal euros per year
round8_AT$atry_h[round8_AT$hinctnta==1] <- 14800/2
round8_AT$atry_h[round8_AT$hinctnta==2] <- (14800+19800)/2

# Attributed experience

blix <- papeR::summarize(round8_AT)
knitr::kable(blix, type = "numeric",format="pandoc",
             caption="Means of ESSA data Round 8 Austria")

```

Now, run the regression. 

```{r pander_AT, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

# Now run the Mincerian function
panderOptions("digits",4)
pander(lm(atry_lni~edu_VOC+edu_TER+ atr_exp + I(atr_exp^2)+FEMALE+MIGRANT,weights=pspwght,data=round8_AT),

```

# Just some fun with R markdown in knitr.

There is a lot going on here between R, latex and pandoc, but the intermediate tex file is always a recourse in case things become iffy trying to run latex commands from inside the .rmd files.

\begin{shaded}

Red text with a gray background.

\end{shaded}

Red text.

\color{black}

Black text.

\colorlet{shadecolor}{red!10} 

\begin{shaded}

Black text with a red background.

\end{shaded}

\colorlet{shadecolor}{red!90} 

\begin{shaded}

Black text with a darker red background. Trying this for a code chunk
will show the begin and end latex commands which I don't know yet how
to supress, if at all it is possible in the current set-up.
